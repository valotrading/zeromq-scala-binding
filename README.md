# Scala Binding for ZeroMQ

The Scala binding for ZeroMQ is based on ZeroMQ versions 2.1.x and uses [JNA][]
for accessing native functions. It is a thin wrapper of the ZeroMQ API, but
offers also a `jzmq`-like API intending to be compatible with the Java binding
for ZeroMQ; users of the Java binding wanting to access ZeroMQ over JNA can
switch over to the Scala binding.
